# Manvi AI

Manvi AI is a virtual assistant application that combines natural language interaction, application integration, and AI-powered code generation. It provides a seamless and intuitive communication experience, allowing users to interact with the AI assistant using speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis.

## Features

- **Natural Language Interaction:** Engage in conversations with the AI assistant using spoken language, thanks to the integration of the `speech_recognition` library for speech-to-text conversion and the `pyttsx3` library for text-to-speech synthesis.

- **Application Integration:** Easily open various applications through voice commands. The application seamlessly integrates with web browsers, music players, and even coding environments like VS Code, utilizing libraries such as `webbrowser` and the operating system's default player.

- **AI-Powered Code Generation:** Leverage the power of AI for code generation tasks. The OpenAI API, along with the GPT-3.5 model, enables the virtual assistant to generate code snippets and perform natural language processing tasks, enhancing productivity for developers.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Run the `manvi_ai.py` script to start the application.
3. Speak to the AI assistant, ask questions, or give commands.
4. Enjoy the seamless communication, application integration, and AI-powered code generation features.
